    <span class="slug">Web</span>Cross-platform mobile applications using React Native. Web APIs with Django and DRF. Web apps with Django and jQuery. A couple of years ago I wrote an application for <a href="http://www.dronfelipe.com/posts/clustering_location_history">clustering Google location history records</a>, finding frequently visited locations, and responding to time-sensitive queries about a user’s location history via the Google Maps API. Google later released a very similar app called "timeline"...
