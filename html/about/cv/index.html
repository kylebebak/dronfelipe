Worked on OPI’s data warehouse API, implementing authorization and logging systems for flagship application (Sinatra). Designed and wrote all layers of Intelligent Billing web application for AutoFacil (LAMP). Wrote application for <a href="http://www.dronfelipe.com/posts/clustering_location_history">clustering Google location history records</a>, finding frequently visited locations, and responding to time-sensitive queries about a user’s location history via the Google Maps API.

Implemented locality sensitive hashing to find near-duplicates in a set of ~10 million documents for which pairwise comparison was not feasible. Have worked on various Sublime Text plugins, for example <a href="https://github.com/kylebebak/auto-save">auto-save</a>, which allows you to auto-save one or more files every time they are changed. Combined with <a href="https://github.com/hiddentao/gulp-server-livereload">gulp-server-livereload</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/pwlmaciejewski/markdown-html">markdown-html</a> if I'm writing Markdown, it's what I use to write all my HTML, including this page.
